# KEYWORD:	ssh, python


#             sshpy HOW-TO
# step 1.
#	install python and python module "pexpect"
#	(if you use redhat\centos\fedora, try "yum search")
#	(if you use ubuntu, try "apt-cache search") 
#
#
# step 2.
# 	modify the python dict below:
#	

user_ip_pass = {
"to-be-named-1":["192.168.23.23","58422","root","xxxxxxxx",
     {
            "to-be-named-2":["10.10.123.100","22","admin",""],
            "to-be-named-3":["10.10.123.101","8022","root","xxxxxxxx"],
     }
    ],
"to-be-named-4":["192.168.23.23","58422","root","xxxxxxxx"]
}

#	the key in this dict is the name for the login information.
#	the value is an array. Here is the definition of the array.
#		1:hostname
#		2:port
#		3:user
#		4:password 
#		
#
# step 3.
#	for example, if you need to login server "to-be-named-1" in 
#	order to login server "to-be-named-2", you only need to ty-
#	-pe the following command:
#		./sshpy to-be-named-1 to-be-named-2
#
#	if you forgot the information defined in the user_ip_pass. 
#	type this one:
#		./sshpy
#	
#	then some login information will be shown.
#
# finally.
#	the command "ifconfig | grep inet\ addr" will be executed 
#	if you successfully login for safety. ( to ensure you ar-
#	-e currently using the right machine.)
#
#	enjoy it~ :)
